## About
This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build the pages, from the
content in the Markdown files. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll 
`_config.yml` configuration file.

Future: Markdown content should be in the `md_content` folder and HTML content
should be in the `content` folder. The site should be built and deployed into
`docs` using AWCM. Github Pages will be reconfigured to read plain HTML from 
the `docs` folder on the *master* branch
