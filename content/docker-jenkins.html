<h1 id="jenkins">Running Jenkins inside Docker</h1>
<p>I heard it's possible to run Jenkins in its own container, and give it access to the host's 
Docker executable, so it can create sibling containers (rather than running child containers in a
docker-on-docker situation)</p>

<p>The trick is to mount the docker.sock file and the docker binary, so the Jenkins container is
using the same executable to spawn containers. We also need to align users and groups between 
the host and the container.</p>





<div style="float:left">

  <div style="max-width:700px">
  <h2>Updated</h2>
  <p>In the original implementation, the docker socket <b>and</b> the docker binary were mounted
  into the Jenkins container with "-v", but this led to shared library issues in certain versions
  of Jenkins. I've updated these instructions
  now that I've changed the approach to install the binary in the jenkins container</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div style="clear:both"></div><!-- CLEAR FLOATS FOR SIDEBAR -->



<h2>Add group to the Jenkins image</h2>

<p>I created a custom <code>Dockerfile</code> that configures the Jenkins user to be a member of the 
docker group and installs docker, (other dependencies are mentioned in the 'issues' section towards the
end of this article):
<!-- UPDATE: 
     Added apt-get install line 
     Removed groupadd command:
        RUN groupadd -g 999 docker
-->
<pre>
FROM jenkinsci/jenkins:2.60.1
USER root
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y docker.io
RUN usermod -a -G docker jenkins
USER jenkins
</pre>
<ul>
    <li>jenkinsci/* is the official package on docker hub. The top level one isn't used.</li>
    <!--I encountered shared library errors with Jenkins 2.61 when I was trying to volume-mount the
        'docker' binary, and downgraded to v2.50. The shared library errors were probably caused by 
        the container being built against a different kernel. The correct fix was to apt-get install
        the docker binary into the container.-->
    <li>The custom image is then created with <tt>docker build -t jenkins2-img .</tt></li>

</ul>
</p>



<h2>Create a data volume</h2>
<p>Jenkins data needs to persist over a reboot of the Jenkins-master container.
To overcome the problem of ephemeral storage in Docker, create a "data container" that 
will store the filing system used by Jenkins.
<pre>
# Dockerfile-data
FROM debian:jessie
RUN useradd -d "/var/jenkins_home" -u 1000 -m -s /bin/bash jenkins
RUN mkdir -p /var/log/jenkins
RUN chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/log/jenkins
VOLUME ["/var/log/jenkins", "/var/jenkins_home"]
USER jenkins
CMD ["echo", "Data container for Jenkins"]
</pre>
</p>
<p>Build the data container with <tt>docker build -t jenkins2-data -f Dockerfile-data .</tt>
</p>
<p>This will be attached to the Jenkins container with the argument <tt>--volumes-from=jenkins2-data</tt></p>



<h2>Run the container(s)</h2>
<p>I tried to use <tt>docker-compose</tt> to launch the containers, but it doesn't appear to have all
the options I need (the latest version may be closer!). In particular, I need to specify a user and
group to run the container as.</p>
<p>In the following script, we launch the data container, if it hasn't already been launched. It will 
terminate straight away, but the volumes are still available for use
</p>
<p>Then, launch the Jenkins container, mounting the data container and the docker.sock file 
<!--and the docker executable itself-->.</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$(docker ps -a | grep jenkins2-data)" ]; then
    echo "Launching Jenkins-Data container"
    docker run --name=jenkins2-data jenkins2-data
else
    echo "Jenkins-Data container is ready"
fi

echo "Lauching Jenkins app"
cwd=$(pwd)
GROUP_ID=$(grep docker /etc/group | cut -d: -f3)
docker run -u jenkins:${GROUP_ID} \
  --volumes-from=jenkins2-data \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  <!-- -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker \ 
  -->      -p 8082:8080 \
        -p 50000:50000 \
        --name jenkins2-master \
        -d \
        jenkins2-img \

echo "You can find the initial 'admin' password with:"
echo "  docker exec jenkins2-master cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword"

echo "To stop, use: "
echo "  docker stop jenkins2-master; docker rm jenkins2-master"
</pre>
<p>
  <b>Note</b> that I've chosen to expose the Jenkins web interface on port 8082.
</p>
<p>
  You can now point your browser at Jenkins and perform the initial setup (for which you
  will need the admin password hinted at in the script above)
</p>



<h2>Testing it</h2>
<p>
    We're going to run a really simple container to prove it works. My personal favourite test image 
    is "tutum/hello-world". It's a very simple container that runs nginx with a single PHP page showing 
    the container's hostname. We can test our Docker-Jenkins installation with it.
</p>
<p>
    <b>First</b>, make sure this image is NOT present on the host with the <code>docker ps -a ...</code> and
    <code>docker rmi ...</code> commands.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Second</b>, create a Jenkins job to run the container: (wording from
    <a href="http://container-solutions.com/running-docker-in-jenkins-in-docker/">here</a>)
    <ul>
        <li>Open the Jenkins home page (http://localhost:8082/) in a browser and click the “create new jobs” link.</li>
        <li>Enter the item name (“docker-test-001”), select “Freestyle project” and click OK.</li>
        <li>On the configuration page, click “Add build step” then “Execute shell”.</li>
        <li>In the command box enter “docker run -d -p 8081:80 tutum/hello-world”</li>
        <li>Click “Save”.</li>
        <li>Click “Build Now”.</li>
    </ul> 
</p>
<p>
    Now if you look on the HOST (<code>docker ps </code>), you'll see the "tutum/hello-world" container is running
    as well as the jenkins2-master
</p>
<p>
    To prove the Jenkins data persists, shut down and restart the "jenkins2-master" container from the host.
    You will see your test job and results are still there.
</p>


<h2>Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
      I had to downgrade Jenkins to 2.50 to get docker-on-docker to work. 2.60.1 gave me errors when
      I tried to "docker run...". e.g. <tt>"libltdl.so.7: cannot open shared object file" error:</tt>
      I think this is addressed 
      <a href="http://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/">here</a> (see the 
      end of the article); You still share the socket, but install your own docker executable inside
      the jenkins image. It also suggests that using the Docker API might be a suitable alternative.
      <br>
      This was indeed the case. The article above has been updated, and I was able to upgrade Jenkins again.
  </li>
  <li>
      I tried the Alpine Linux version, but ran into problems creating the user in the Dockerfile in
      Alpine/Busybox.
  </li>
  <li>
      Because I was using an older version of Jenkins, I had to manually install older versions of the
      plugins. When I eventually worked out the dependency order, I was able to start with the modules that
      had no dependencies, and gradually install the rest
  </li>
  <li>
      To add virtualenv to the Jenkins master, I added the following RUN command to the Dockerfile:<br>
      <tt>RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python-virtualenv</tt>
  </li>
  <li>
      Jenkins needs lots of things installed. e.g. "pip install lxml" needed libxslt and cc
  </li>
  <li>
      compiling lxml in your "pip install" step takes time. Consider apt-get install python-lxml in the Dockerfile
      to speed things up
  </li>
</ul>
